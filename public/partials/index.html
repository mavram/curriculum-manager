        <p>Plutarch in his biography of the Athenian king Theseus (the slayer of the Minotaur) relates that, after being
            widowed and reaching age 50, the King abducted the beautiful 12-year old Helen (long before she married
            Menealaus, met Paris and was the cause of the Trojan War). Due to this outrage her twin brothers Castor and
            Pollux invaded Attica to liberate their sister and threatened to destroy Athens. Akademos spared the city by
            telling them her location (concealed at Aphidnae). For this Akademos was venerated by the city as a
            savior.Also for this reason the Tyndarids always showed him much gratitude, and whenever the Lacedaemonians
            invaded Attica, they always spared the land belonging to Academus which lay on the Cephissus, six stadia
            from Athens.
            This piece of land was subsequently adorned with plane and olive plantations, and was called Academia from
            its original owner.
            This grove of trees on the northwest side of the city, held to be his burial place, was ever after dedicated
            to his memory. Within this grove Plato gave his lectures and thus the phrase "the groves of Academe."Due to
            this Akademos' name has been linked to the archaic name for the site of Plato's Academy, the Hekademeia,
            outside the walls of Athens.
            Akademeia was the source of the word "academy". The expression "the Grove of Academe" refers to the sacred
            site of Hekademos where the cult had once taken place in an olive grove sacred to Athena.
